# Security Policy

This package is the **Announcement Bar** plugin for
[Nioteq CMS](https://github.com/tklmn/nioteq-cms). It runs inside the CMS and
inherits the host's security controls (nonce-based CSP, RBAC, CSRF, rate limiting).

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are released for the latest minor version line. Upgrade to the
latest release rather than expecting back-ported patches.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 1.0.x   | ✅ |
| < 1.0   | ❌ |

disclosure.
