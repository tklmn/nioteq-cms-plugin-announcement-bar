## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Security policy (`SECURITY.md`) with coordinated vulnerability reporting, and a CycloneDX SBOM under `sbom/` (this package has no third-party runtime dependencies). Brings the plugin to supply-chain/CRA parity with the CMS core.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- CSP compatibility: inline `<script>` tags now carry the `@cspNonce` directive, and the inline event handlers (the bar's dismiss button, color-picker mirroring in the settings) were switched to `addEventListener`. This makes it work under the CMS's strict, nonce-based Content Security Policy.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-08

### Security
- Settings page is now protected by `permission:manage-plugins` — previously any logged-in backend user could change the site-wide Announcement Bar.

### Fixed
- Strict hex validation for `bg_color`/`text_color` (`#RGB`/`#RRGGBB`) instead of a mere length check — prevents CSS injection via the color fields.
